# BubbleBlast

A copy of the Bubble blast game in written in Visual Basic.
The levels are randomly generated but the random number sequence is the same everytime, which means that the same levels are generated each time, and there are infinite number of levels.

The Visual studio Powerpack was used when the project was created (~2010)
